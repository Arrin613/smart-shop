I have made an automated smart shop using :-
Arduino Uno
I2c lcd display
2 servo motors
2 ir sensors(optional for automated gates)
push button
red and green led's
MFRC522 rfid card reader


This is a simple fun project which add particular shopping items with help of card reader and final bill can be seen through a master card , items can also be added or removed simulatneously by selsction particular card of that item and by pressing a push button
